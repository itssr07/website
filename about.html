            <p><h3>The beauty of nature can have a profound effect upon our senses, those gateways from the outer world to the inner, whether it<br>
                 results in disbelief in its very existence as Emerson notes, or feelings such as awe, wonder, or amazement. 
                  But what is it about<br> nature and the entities that make it up that cause us, oftentimes unwillingly, to feel or declare
                   that they are beautiful?</h3></p>

            <p> <h3>One answer that Emerson offers is that “the simple perception of natural forms is a delight.”  When we think of
 beauty in nature,<br> we might most immediately think of things that dazzle the senses – the prominence of a mountain,
  the expanse of the sea, the unfolding<br> of the life of a flower. Often it is merely the perception of these things
   itself which gives us pleasure, and this emotional or affective response<br> on our part seems to be crucial to our experience of beauty
    .  So in a way there is a correlate here to the intrinsic value of nature</h3></p>
